## Overview

Putty Madness is a tool for keeping track of lots of different SSH hosts that you connect to through Simon Tatham's PuTTY software. It remembers where they are, what jumphost you need to use to get to them, which credentials you're supposed to use, etc.

It also includes a keyboard hook function that lets you send commands to many PuTTY windows at once, a grouping ability that lets you open multiple sessions in the same place on your screen(s), and a system tray app that lets you launch sessions from a hotkey.

## Installation

The easiest way to install is to download and run the MSI (Windows Installer) file below. Or if you prefer a portable
